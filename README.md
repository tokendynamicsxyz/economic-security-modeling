# Economic Security Modeling

This repository offers different methods of finding and presenting economic security vulnerabilities, using actual exploits as case studies.

At the moment, these are very much preliminary works-in-progress. Much cleaning, refactoring, etc. is required. 

* `mango-analysis`:  an academic math overview, from first principles, fo the 2023 Mango Markets exploit.
* `bonq-visualization`: visualizations of dependencies and impact of economic variables in the BonqDAO system, using slither and python. 
* `hoyu-exploration`: optimization-based search for bad debt in the Hoyu system, using foundry and python.
